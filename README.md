# Custard.js
Custard.js is a lightweight Javascript library that provides a simple, robust, standardised approach to customising online checkout pages for Shopify themes.

It's based on the design patterns and development work conducted at [Disco], and is designed for use by freelancers, developers and agencies working with [Shopify Plus] merchants.

Custard.js is currently only licensed for use by Disco, Disco's Premium Agency Partners, and customers of Gavin Ballard's [Checkout Customisation Toolkit] resource. 
It's designed to work seamlessly with the patterns and approaches outlined in the Toolkit.
